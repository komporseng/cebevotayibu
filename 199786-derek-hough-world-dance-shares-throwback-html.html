One time, Julianna <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/derek-julianne-hough-open-up-about-how-their-challenging-childhood-shaped-their-success/>said</a>, "I got off at the wrong train station.

In his memoir, "Taking the Lead: Lessons from a Life in Motion," Derek opened up about everything.</p><p class=Zg>He revealed that his mother instructed him to hit back at his peers, and he obeyed.

He spoke about not judging people, especially when you don't know their situation.</p><p class=Zg>Rather, the father-son duo pushed for empathy and compassion. They also noted how time is short, and one should spend as much of it with loved ones while possible.</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>A dance with mom</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg><a class="zd d" href=#>Earlier this month</a>, Derek did just that when he danced with his mother, Mari Anne Hough, in a cute video.
