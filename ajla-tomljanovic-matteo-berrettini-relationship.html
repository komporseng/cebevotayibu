Before that, an Instagram post of the duo visiting an Italian restaurant in New York also raised the eyebrows of many.</p><p>In October 2019, Ajla Tomljanovic’s boyfriend, Matteo, posted a picture of them together for the first time. The duo was walking around and shopping in Vienna, Austria.

Now that the couple has made their relationship official, they are also seen supporting their partners at each others’ matches.</p><p>In an interview, Ajla Tomljanovic’s beau <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">revealed that</a> he likes it when they are playing at the same time because he feels ten times more stressed while watching her match. Ajla also added that it’s better to play at the same time as it takes away the stress that she has when watching from the locker room.</p><p>Not only that, but Matteo also becomes nervous when he cannot see her scores and imagines worst-case scenarios. His girlfriend revealed that whenever she finishes, and he’s in the third set, she won’t go there, maybe due to superstition.</p><p>It is clear that the couple supports each other in their respective careers. We hope to see the pair clinching Grand Slam titles in the upcoming days.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ajla_Previously_Dated_A_Tennis_Player></span>Ajla Previously Dated A Tennis Player<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Matteo Berrettini and Ajla Tomljanovic’s relationship&nbsp;is the talk of the town now, it is not the first time that she has dated a tennis player.
