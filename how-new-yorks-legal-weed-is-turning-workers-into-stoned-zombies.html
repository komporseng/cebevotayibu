She closed the register. I had to wait for someone to come with the dreaded key. After 10 minutes for a 30-second transaction, she didn’t even apologize.”</p><p>Responding to a tweet I posted about discombobulated workers, a follower wrote to say that “The woman running the service desk” at a major Sunset Park auto dealer “was clearly high … had no idea what was going on. Lost my car twice during routine service.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">With every kind of marijuana-related product widely available, New York is no longer the Big Apple —&nbsp;call it the Big Blunt. <span class=credit>Shutterstock</span></figure><p>Real estate man Jordan Cohn tweeted, “I just had a restaurant server lose my credit card.
