The rules were off, and young people embraced their new-found freedom to the fullest.</p><p>“Be seen, be loved, be picked up, be drugged, be sexed, be crazy,” Maripol, an artist and fashion designer, remembered of the general vibe of the music craze. “Be 100 percent who you are.”</p><p>The owners of now-iconic clubs like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Studio 54</a>, The Electric Circus, Ice Palace 57, and Hurrah created spaces for New Yorkers to explore their own sexualities and embrace different means of self-expression.</p><p>“In a sense, they were making it so that normal or ‘vanilla’ people weren’t allowed in and the most extravagant people were,” said Lissa Rivera, the curator for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Museum of Sex’s</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Night Fever exhibit</a>. “If you were really young and hot, or weird and queer — especially trans women — it was your scene. They were really the stars, which makes sense because they were just the most beautiful and exciting people in the club.”</p><p>That didn’t mean the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">style bar</a> wasn’t high. In fact, it had been raised.</p><p>People gathered in bellbottoms, scarves, thongs, feathers, platform shoes, velvet vests, ruffled shirts, quaffed hair, and makeup that took hours to apply.</p><p>“Nobody ever repeated what they wore the night before, the week before, or the month before,” musical artist Corey Day said. “If you didn’t have a good look, you couldn’t go in.”</p><p>Some of the best looks were documented by photographer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Bernstein</a>.</p><p>While on an assignment covering Lillian Carter for The Village Voice in 1977, Bernstein found himself in the heart of the blossoming movement. Mesmerized, he’d stay there for the next two years.</p><p>While most media outlets focused on the celebrities at these clubs, Bernstein felt the not-so-ordinary ordinary attendees often made more intriguing subjects.</p><p>“We would spend a week just working on one outfit,” now-nightclub owner Eric Goode said of how regular people could stand out. “Because we didn’t have a lot of money, because we weren’t famous, because I wasn’t a model, it had to be really creative.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-105469 alt="Disco History" width=900 height=614 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/studio-couple-bowties.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-105469 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bill Bernstein/Museum of Sex</span><span class=caption-body>Studio 54</span></p><p>Disco’s roots in gay activism are often forgotten today.</p><p>The movement really began with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stonewall Riots</a> of 1969, the first major incident in which gay men took a collective and forceful stand against police brutality.</p><p>The rioting became a catalyst for the sexual revolution, which then gave way to disco fever.</p><p>“If you don’t have the gays you wouldn’t have the culture,” Joey Arias, a gay performing artist told the museum. “The gays open the world of freedom. The gays always push things. They’re kind of like the Apostles of the sexual revolution.”</p><p>DJs at the clubs began playing music created by gay men, openly sexual women, and black artists. Donna Summer simulated orgasms in songs and the Village People would fling off police uniforms, construction hats, and cowboy outfits in a celebration of gay culture.</p><p>By circumventing the normal, top-down spread of popular music — whereby prominent labels would choose the hits, which they’d then give to radio, which would eventually pass them down to DJs — these clubs pushed minority artists into the mainstream without “the Man’s” permission.</p><p>Soon enough, Midwesterners belted out the Village People’s “YMCA” at baseball games and Disney cartoon characters rocked out under glittering disco balls.</p><p>“That was queer culture they were participating in without even knowing it,” Rivera said.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-105468 alt="Paradise Garage" width=900 height=613 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/paradise-garage-dj.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-105468 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bill Bernstein/Museum of Sex</span><span class=caption-body>Paradise Garage</span></p><p>Of course, disco wasn’t just about the looks. It was more about the experience.</p><p>People would have sex in corners, bathrooms, stairwells, and closets. They’d do cocaine, Quaaludes, and poppers on the dance floor. Crowds of club goers would gyrate and pulse together to the beats — like a single, glittering amoeba.</p><p>Young starving artists stepped off of New York’s dark and grimy streets into what felt like another world.</p><p>“The economy was really at rock bottom and artists could afford to live in the city much cheaper,” Rivera said. “So it was still the place to be where creative people would have open spaces to explore and party until four in the morning.”</p><p>But the city has changed a lot since then — rents have skyrocketed to a place where artists are lucky to find a reasonably priced basement in Brooklyn. Walk into most Manhattan bars and you’ll likely meet people in finance who pull in six-figure salaries and dress in conservative suits.</p><p>“I think when a lot of people think of New York, they think of what it was in the ’70s,” Rivera said. “And when they come here, they’re looking for it and they can’t find it.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-105466 alt="GG's Barnum Room" width=600 height=900 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/barnum-room-girls.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-105466 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bill Bernstein/Museum of Sex</span><span class=caption-body>GG’s Barnum Room</span></p><p>The disco movement, as it originally was, ended in the ’80s, as the AIDS epidemic stormed through the gay community and fear settled over the formerly jubilant clubs.</p><p>But vestiges remain: Velvet ropes still part for the chicest outfit, style mavens still fill gay clubs and parades, and music trends continue to transcend race and sexuality.</p><p>Moreover, ongoing rights movements continue the fight for the kind of inclusiveness that these clubs helped pioneer.</p><p>“Disco left a permanent impact around the world, for us, in every sort of way,” Manetta said. “Even the word, you know what it means — it means something. I watched it happen, I watched the music, people change. You can’t stop a river from flowing, and that’s how I felt about Disco.”</p><p>After learning the history of disco, take a look at these <a href=#>stunning photos of Paris in the 1920s</a>.
