At least 93 people have died, and there are at least 1,000 people missing, according to reports. The historic town of Lahaina is in ruins as a result of these flames, which destroyed more than 1,700 buildings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fire-and-Fury-the-story-of-the-2023-Maui-Fire-min-1024x580.jpg><p>The governor of Hawaii describes this fire as the worst natural disaster to ever affect the state and links it to global warming. These flames are a part of a global pattern of severe weather conditions that are becoming more closely linked to climate change induced by human activity.</p><p>Worldwide, wildfires have wreaked havoc this summer, killing at least seven people in Greece alone. These fires have affected both the mainland and the islands.</p><p>Thousands of people have been forced to abandon their homes in Spain and Portugal because of raging fires, and Spain has reported 300 heat-related deaths. I personally saw two wildfires just last month while traveling in the Iberian Peninsula.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bad_Years_for_Forest_Fires></span><strong>Bad Years for Forest Fires</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wildfires in Algeria and Tunisia have swept throughout North Africa, killing at least 34 people in 2023. Over 25,000 acres of forest have been burned in Canada during a record-breaking wildfire season, creating spectacular photos of smoke surrounding New York City.</p><p>Over 20 people have died and 1,100,000 acres have been burnt in Chile as a result of the worst drought in a millennium. In addition, 14 people tragically lost their lives in Kazakhstan, and a fire devastated about 150,000 acres of land. This is not exclusive to 2023. Recent data on forest fires indicates a worrying reality: these fires have become more frequent and larger in scope than they were 20 years ago, decimating almost twice as much tree cover.</p><p>Researchers from the University of Maryland found that since 2001, the annual area of tree cover lost to forest fires has increased by 3 million hectares, or about the same as Belgium. Alarmingly, these fires are to blame for more than 25% of all tree cover loss over the past 20 years.</p><p>One of the worst years for forest fires since 2000, 2021 was exceptionally bad. Over a third of the world’s entire tree cover was destroyed in that year, which amounted to an astounding 9.3 million hectares. The estimated $69 billion in overall economic damages from wildfires worldwide between 2018 and 2022 included $39 billion in insurance company payments.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Planetary_warming_that_is_ongoing></span><strong>Planetary warming that is ongoing</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Particularly in temperate zones with erratic rainfall and protracted warm spells, wildfire risk is significant. There is a greater chance of loss as urban areas spread into forested areas.</p><p>According to studies, the likelihood of devastating wildfires, such as those that occurred during Australia’s “black summer” of 2019–2020, has increased four times since pre-industrial times.</p><p>Wildfires have also been a result of heat waves and droughts in Europe. Due to the increasing frequency of wildfires, it has even become somewhat socially awkward to wish someone a happy summer vacation in countries like Sweden.</p><p>Wildfire activity is getting worse, and it’s intimately related to climate change. Climate change has increased the likelihood of major flames by increasing the frequency and length of heatwaves, which are now five times more common than they were 150 years ago.</p><p>Increased evaporation of moisture from soil and plants as a result of rising temperatures makes them drier and more prone to catching fire. Because of the increasing dryness, wildfires can start and spread easily in this setting.</p><p>Traditional patterns of rainfall are also altered by climate change, leading to erratic changes in where and when it rains. Such modifications can lead to an imbalance in the components that can start fires and have an impact on how vegetation grows.</p><p>Plants dry out more quickly in places with less rainfall, which provides plenty of fuel for wildfires. On the other hand, too much rain can result in an abundance of plants, which eventually dries out during dry spells and turns into fuel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Globally_coordinated_effort></span><strong>Globally coordinated effort</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wildfire seasons, which historically only happened during a few specified months, have expanded and intensified. Wildfires have greater opportunities to start and spread throughout this prolonged period. It becomes increasingly challenging to properly battle these fires as a result of the limited resources available for managing fires.</p><p>A change in the atmosphere brought on by warmer temperatures can also increase the likelihood of thunderstorms and lightning. Climate-induced dryness makes dry vegetation an ideal target for lightning-caused fires, especially in locations where lightning was previously uncommon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter">Fire and Fury the story of the 2023 Maui Fire</figure><p>The link between wildfires and climate change has the potential to produce feedback loops that exacerbate the issue. For instance, wildfires spread additional global warming by releasing a lot of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as they burn.</p><p class=has-medium-font-size><strong>Also, Read</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtonpmnsm6tzZ1kn62irnq1tMRmqq2noq56sLKMrZ%2BeZZ2Wwqp5xaKpnmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
