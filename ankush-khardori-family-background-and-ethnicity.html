of corporate crime and financial fraud.</p><p>He was successful in convicting white-collar criminals thanks to his exceptional academic background and private legal skills.</p><p>2020 saw Khardori leave the public sector and go on to become a well-known media personality, editor, legal commentator, advisor, and writer who shared his deep knowledge of the legal system.</p><h2><span

information about them is available to the general public.</p><p>They have purposefully avoided drawing attention to their names, occupations, and most other personal information.</p><p>Unlike their son, who has become well-known, Ankush’s parents have kept a very low profile and avoided the spotlight.</p><p>Even though Ankush’s parents have concealed their names, it is nonetheless evident how important a role they had in shaping his prosperous professional path.</p><p>It is also impossible to overestimate the crucial role his parents played in paving the road for their son’s rise to popularity, even if they have shied away from the spotlight his son demands.</p><h2><span id=Background_of_Ankush_Khardori8217s_Family>Background of Ankush Khardori’s Family</span></h2><p>Ankush Khardori has become a well-known professional after an extraordinary career that included significant legal positions and well-respected media analysis and commentary.</p><p>His parents moved to New York before he was born, having left Kashmir, India.</p><p>Khardori’s family moved to Springfield, Illinois, from New York City after he spent his early years there.</p><p>It was in these early years that he learned the value of education and the necessity of hard labor.</p><p>Even though his parents have stayed out of the spotlight, their assistance was essential in helping Khardori get into Columbia University, an Ivy League university, for his undergraduate studies.</p><p>This intellectual basis then served as a launching pad for law school.</p><h2><span id=ethnicity_of_Ankush_Khardori>ethnicity of Ankush Khardori</span></h2><p>Ankush Khardori’s parents immigrated to America from Kashmir, India, and raised him.</p><p>Because of his lineage, he was raised in an environment that was deeply ingrained in Indian and Kashmiri traditions, customs, cuisine, and close-knit family ties.</p><p>Khardori’s early life was shaped by his Indian-Kashmiri family’s decision to follow the American dream after his parents left to immigrate overseas before he was born.</p><p>As a member of a close-knit ethnic community in America, their choice exposed Khardori to his rich ancestral Kashmiri culture.</p><p>while also coming to appreciate the chances, diversity, and aspiration for upward mobility that his family’s relocation to the US represented.</p><p>Khardori has a distinct viewpoint influenced by customs, meritocracy, justice, and equality because of his dual cultural identities—Kashmiri ancestry and American legal profession.</p><p>In a society that is becoming more and more diverse, his background enables him to bridge gaps between different cultures.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1
