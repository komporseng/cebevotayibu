This cosmic setting provides the narrative for my content-driven work, the writing and design. I explore metaphors that underlie both growing nature and the laws of nature, parallels that root us personally in the cosmos as firmly as a plant, even while our mind escapes this home.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-27718 alt="Spiral Pond" width=900 height=629 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/JencksLandscapesSpiralPond.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-27718 class=wp-caption-text>Source: Paranoias</p><p>With names like “The Garden of Cosmic Speculation” and “Northumberlandia”, the Lady of the North, Charles Jencks’ creations are as grandiose as they are mesmerizing.

The giant land sculpture in the shape of a reclining woman consists of 1.5 million metric tons of earth, earning it the rather obscure title of “largest land sculpture of a female form in the world.” With the goal of becoming a major tourist attraction, the site was officially opened by Princess Anne on August 29th, 2012 and was fully opened to the public in October of that year.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-27713 alt=Northumberlandia width=900 height=586 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/JencksLandscapesLadyLandOverhead.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-27713 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>The Washington Post</a></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-27712 alt="Charles Jencks Landscape Art" width=900 height=562 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/JencksLandscapesLadyLandFace.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-27712 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Slow Life</a></p><p>As a leading figure in British landscape architecture, Charles Jencks is also responsible for what appears before the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in collaboration with Terry Farrell and Duncan Whatmore.</p><p>On top of his design work, Charles Jencks is also well known for his writings on postmodernism and architecture. He has written several books on the subject which are typically met with high acclaim and often used in architectural classes.</p><p>Jencks has also been known to be very critical of current architecture and design as a whole, often sparking debate.
