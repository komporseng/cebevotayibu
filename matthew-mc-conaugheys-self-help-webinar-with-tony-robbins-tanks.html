The <a href=#>Oscar-winning actor</a> presented the webinar on April 24 but failed to muster up much interest.</p><p>During the webinar, <a href=#>Camila Alves</a>' husband played the bongos and delivered ambiguous advice on self-improvement before presenting a programme called '<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Road Trip: The Highway to More</a>'.&nbsp;Motivational speaker Tony Robbins and entrepreneur Dean Graziosi also joined McConaughey in the 'Art of Livin' seminar as they rolled out the eight-week package, with the "lowered" price tag of $397 for those who tuned in for the online event.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=#>Matthew McConaughey tries his hand at hairdressing as he cuts 10-year-old son Livingston's hair</a></p><p><a href=#>'Someone with a dream': Matthew McConaughey to play 'Agent Elvis' in Netflix spy comedy</a></p><h2 class=split>‘Be cool to your future self and show up’</h2><p>The course promises to help students "live up to their full potential." However, a large number of viewers have now denounced the seminar as a 'shameful' cash grab. Over 2.4 million individuals 'attended' McConaughey's self-help seminar, which was promoted as a "intimate one-time event to create a future you can look forward to".&nbsp;</p><p>McConaughey had advertised the lecture, urging attendees to "be cool to your future self and show up." Viewers who pay for the two-month course will be guided through nine "mile markers on your highway to more," with names like "more you," "more cool," and "more selfish."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/ac4c9db5-b02d-4409-813b-11457fb1e9ae.jpg><p>A wide-eyed McConaughey went on to make several odd statements in the webinar, including: 'The art of livin’ starts with admittin’ – if we want to be legit, we gotta first admit. Yeah, I just rhymed. Guilty. I do that. All the time...'&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'This turned into a sales pitch’</h2><p>Viewers were also encouraged to "identify, claim, and announce" their motives for progress, in which they journaled their objectives in order to make them a reality.&nbsp; However, many viewers were left unsatisfied as the actor spent several hours spewing off unclear advice such as "not being lazy with yourself" and "asking ourselves the right questions."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/02eb1844-3129-4f39-90d5-468fad0398e9.png><p>But many took to social media to hit out at the event for being a cash-grab, with one warning: "Don't bother - infomercial." "This turned into a pitch for an expensive class. Not alright," added another.&nbsp;A third viewer who said she was "broke" due to caring for her sick husband slammed the webinar, saying: "I definitely didn't expect a huge sales pitch that I and probably a bunch of others can't afford... bummed."</p><h2 class=split>'You're good crazy, not bad crazy'</h2><p>Speaking beside an artificial laugh track and applause generator, he advised the audience to forsake 'the 9-5 job' in order to pursue a million-dollar business idea. "I'm here because I am not making straight A's in everything that I'm preaching about and stuff that I've already learned I'm still not living up to," continued the actor, as he spoke through terms including "complacency" and "illusions."&nbsp;</p><p>In one of the odder parts of the hour-long session, McConaughey grabbed up his bongo drum and tapped along while reading aloud respondents' reasons for enrolling in the online course. "I want a better life!" he began. "I want to be a better husband! I'm a self-sabotager!"</p><p>However, viewers were let down when the celebrity hosts finished the webcast with a pitch to buy their costly motivational programme.&nbsp; Later in the lecture, McConaughey introduced Tony Robbins, a prominent motivational speaker who told the 'Interstellar' star that he was "digging everything you're talking about."&nbsp;</p><p>"You're good crazy, not bad crazy," he added. The conference, which will be held every week, is owned by Mind Mint LLC, which is owned by Robbins and Graziosi, as well as McConaughey's firm Barefoot Money Inc.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZGpwamx1maknGWTpLuiwcahnLKrXaiyrbKMoZylqF2ssqO1zZqpZq%2BZqbVuwM6nsGaqn5evqrrSZquappuo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
