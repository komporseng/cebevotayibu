She attained her career-high WTA singles ranking of No. 24 on December 12, 2022. On May 9, 2022, she attained her highest WTA doubles ranking of No. 24. She has so far won one singles title and three doubles titles on the WTA Tour (at the 2022 Prague Open). At ITF Women’s Circuit tournaments, Bouzková has won 12 singles titles and three doubles titles. She won the 2014 US Open girls’ singles title by defeating Anhelina Kalinina in the final. She lost in the first round of the 2015 Mexican Open, when she was making her WTA Tour debut. &nbsp;After making it to the 2019 Rogers Cup semifinals, where she defeated Sloane Stephens, Jeena Ostapenko, and Simona Halep before losing to Serena Williams, Bouzková gained notoriety. Despite losing, she pushed the former world No. 1 to three sets, taking the first set 6-1. With her countrywoman Lucie Hradecká, she won her first WTA event championship in doubles at the Birmingham Classic in 2021.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2 id=h-wta-rankings><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-869 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>WTA rankings</h2><p>Bouzková struggled in her first several competitions. She was defeated by Madison Keys in the opening round of the Brisbane International. She also suffered a first-round defeat in the Hobart International the following week. She competed in the main draw of the Australian Open for the first time, however Naomi Osaka, the defending champion, defeated her in the opening round. She failed to record her first victory of 2020 at the Mexican Open, but the following week at the Monterrey Open, she did so by making it to her first WTA tournament final. Elina Svitolina defeated her in a difficult three-set battle in the championship. She debuted in the top 50 at No. 47 on March 9 as a result of her strong performance in Monterrey. In doubles at the Birmingham Classic in June, she and her countrywoman Lucie Hradecká upset Ons Jabeur and Ellen Perez in a hard-fought three-set match to claim their first WTA tournament victory. At the Prague Open, she won a second trophy alongside Hradecká.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2 id=h-2022-journey>2022 journey</h2><p>She defeated qualifier Rebecca Marino in the Australian Open to earn her maiden major victory.

At the Madrid Open, she replicated the record by making it all the way to the third round at a WTA 1000 level. She made it to the second round of a singles match at the French Open for the first time in her career, but COVID-19 forced her to forfeit both her doubles match and her singles match with Elise Mertens. She overcame Caroline Garcia at Wimbledon to advance to her maiden Grand Slam quarterfinal. Bouzková defeated Anastasia Potapova in the Prague Open to win her first WTA competition. As a result, on August 1, 2022, she reentered the top 50 rankings at position 46.</p><h2 id=h-marie-bouzkova-and-her-parents-family><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Marie Bouzkova and her Parents, Family</h2><p>She has a younger brother named Benjamin Milan and was born in Prague to parents Milan and Kvta.
