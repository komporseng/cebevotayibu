The star-studded celebration in Los Angeles acknowledged her achievements and accomplishments in the entertainment business from the beginning of her career.</p><p>It was also her first public appearance since August 2021, when she disclosed her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Friends actor Rachel Bloom grew upset during her award speech, calling her former co-stars Katey Sagal, David Faustino, and Linda Cardellini her “family.” Christina cried as she thanked her daughter Sadie LeNoble, whom she shares with her husband, Martyn LeNoble.</p><h2>Christina Applegate’s spouse Martyn LeNoble</h2><p>Martyn LeNoble, a native of the Netherlands, was born on April 14, 1969, and has had a lifelong interest in music. He used to play bass in a small Dutch band as a youngster before migrating to Los Angeles in 1989.&nbsp;LeNoble moved to Los Angeles and began playing bass in a variety of bands, including The Cult, Too Free Stooges, Thelonious Monster, and Jane’s Addiction. After a short spell with other bands, he co-founded the alternative rock band Porno for Pyros with Peter DiStefano, Perry Farrell, and Stephen Perkins in 1992.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Christina-Applegate.jpg alt="Christina Applegate" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Martyn LeNoble and Christina Applegate were acquaintances for several years before they were romantically involved. According to People Magazine, the actress stated in 2009 that she and Martyn had known one other for 13 years.&nbsp;They started dating in 2008 and were engaged two years later on Valentine’s Day, in 2010. The couple revealed four months later that they were expecting their first child together. Christina Applegate and LeNoble’s first child, a girl called Sadie, was born on January 27, 2011.</p><p>Applegate and LeNoble married in a private ceremony in Los Angeles in February 2013.&nbsp;Applegate felt emotional during her recent address on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, praising her “most important person,” her daughter, Sadie.</p><p>“You are so much more than you realize. You are so beautiful, kind, loving, brilliant, and intriguing, and I am grateful every day that I get to get up and drive you to school. You are everything to me. Thank you for being there for me through it all.”</p><p>However, Sadie is not LaNoble’s first child. Martyn was previously married to Christina Applegate, with whom he had a daughter called Marlon.&nbsp;She is a photographer who graduated from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts and is regularly seen on her father’s social media.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Christina-Applegate-2.jpg alt="Christina Applegate" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Martyn has remained at Christina Applegate’s side throughout her health challenges. The Vacation actress was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a double mastectomy. In an interview with Women’s Health in 2009, Applegate stated:</p><p>“I don’t believe I could have gotten through all of it without him. I laughed more than I ever had in my life in the hospital, making light of all the strange things that were occurring to me.”</p><p>In 2017, she underwent surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes, and the following year, she went through surgical-induced menopause. Applegate revealed her MS difficulties in 2021.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Christina Applegate</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGqusBmmKmonJq0osDEZpyxqKKawLSx0mafnqpdn7y6ecCfq56qXaeypLHIr6Cnn12WerTAwKtkqKZdqbWmeceoo6Wxp6S8pXnWmqOkZZ%2BbeqetzJ5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
