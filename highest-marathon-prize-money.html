Being the best in your athletic field pays off financially, as for some of the <a href=#>highest-paid athletes</a>. Someone who wins a marathon must often train full-time. So, what is the highest marathon <a href=#>prize money</a> ever to be awarded?</p><p>Although the prize structure for marathon winners and top finishers has changed in recent years, there has usually been a significant financial reward for those who cross the finish line first in major marathons. Here's how much the winners of marathons like the <a href=#>Boston Marathon</a> receive, and whether that's really enough for an elite athlete.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Where do runners get the highest marathon prize money?</h2><span id=where-do-runners-get-the-highest-marathon-prize-money class="sc-lmgQde hEekTv"></span><p>In 2023, marathon winners might expect to win tens of thousands of dollars as the reward for their hard work and long months of training.
