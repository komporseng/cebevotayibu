Thousands of men were drawn to her allure, and some may have slipped into her DM to get her attention.</p><p>However, as of Summer 2020, it seemed that she had yet to enter into serious relationships, let alone marry, as she was never seen getting intimate with anyone. Her previous boyfriends and flings even went unnoticed by the media.</p><p>As her career is flourishing, we can presume she is concentrating on her work rather than searching for a future partner.
