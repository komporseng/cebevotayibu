She shares her life with her longtime husband, Ben Falcone.</strong></p><p>Comic star Melissa McCarthy has been married to fellow star Ben Falcone for 15 years, and in all those years, the couple has managed to scale through the scandalous side to being in the spotlight.</p><p>The couple combines <a href=#>family</a> life with their thriving careers while being parents to two girls. While they may seem to have things under control, the pair have confirmed that parenting does have its challenges.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/p/BDJrnqrQpBw/?utm_medium=copy_link</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=McCarthy_and_Bens_Love_Timeline></span>McCarthy and Ben’s Love Timeline<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The couple <a href=#>met in 1998</a> at an improv class at the prestigious Los Angeles-based Improv Company Groundings. They dated for seven years before finally walking down the aisle in 2005.</p><p>The “Bridesmaids” stars welcomed their first child, Vivian Falcone, in 2007, while Georgette joined the family in 2010. McCarthy once admitted that there were parenting hurdles, but her daughters were worth it.</p><p>The “Spy” actress who rarely share their photos has described her girls as “smart and funny,” jokingly adding that they were “weird.” The star mom noted that they were better than her because she was almost 30 before gaining the level of confidence they had.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/p/BDOvRzbQpK7/?utm_medium=copy_link</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Celebration_of_Love></span>A Celebration of Love<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Last year in October, the “Can You Ever Forgive Me” stars <a href=#>celebrated 15 years of marital bliss</a>. The two took to social media, where they shared heartwarming shout outs and a tribute to many more years together.</p><p>McCarthy chose a subtle goofy caption while adding two photos from their romantic moments. She <a href=#>captio</a><a href=#>ned</a>: “15 years ago today, I married the kindest, funniest and weirdest human I’ve ever met. Grateful every single day!!!”</p><p><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/p/CGD8dPTBOVV/</a></p><p>The “Thunder Force” director went all out as he gushed over his wife, referring to her by her nickname, “mooch.” He <a href=#>cheered their love life,</a> noting: “Here’s to 500 more (I am assuming we will kinda be robots for 400 of those years).”</p><p>It is safe to say that McCarthy and Ben are a power couple. Besides co-starring in movies, the pair own a production company, On The Day Productions, which was founded in 2013. The first project from the company is 2014’s “Tammy.”</p><p><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/p/CGEEKufhcfz/</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Secret_to_Their_Long-Lasting_Love></span>The Secret to Their Long-Lasting Love<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The 50-year-old actress once blessed her Instagram timeline with the secret to her love life. She shared a hilarious clip of herself and Ben enjoying a goofy moment.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/p/9l4rXaQpIQ/?utm_medium=copy_link</a></p><p>The couple dressed in matching funky outfits that included an oversized T-shirt, a pair of black shorts, and black fringed wigs. They also sported funny-looking glasses. The secret to her marriage was <a href=#>shared in the caption:</a></p><p>“The real key(s) to happiness: Step one – marry your weird best friend,” McCarthy captioned the post. “Step two – always, and I mean always, have a plethora of wigs in your home.”</p><p>The stars further proved their power couple status last year amid the quarantine lockdown. McCarthy and Ben joined her fellow “Thunder Force” star Olivia Spencer concerning Frontline provision.</p><p>They <a href=#>explained</a> to TV host Hoda Kotb how they worked in donating money to restaurants providing meals for frontline health workers. The couple also briefed her on how they managed family life amid the quarantine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqa4yKyqmmWdmLCivtOhsGagpaivorrDZpmepl2brq2vzqecZqWRp7%2BqscNmaG5lqZqus7%2BMrqWiqaWaerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
