Later this year, additional sections of Pier 6 will open, including three sand-volleyball courts and additional lawn areas. Next year, a restaurant concession with an outdoor roof deck will open.</p><p>“This park is amazing. It brings a whole new dynamic to all of the families of the area,” said George Psarras, of Cobble Hill, after cooling off with his 5-year-old daughter Ariana in a funky, water-play area that features climbing rocks and dome-like sprinklers.</p><p>Ariana said she especially enjoyed the park’s “big slides.”</p><p>Governors Island, which kicked off its summer season today, is open to the public every Friday to Sunday through October 10.</p><p>The free ferries will run continuously for bicyclists and pedestrians on Saturdays and Sundays beginning at 11 am. Gov. Paterson, Mayor Bloomberg and Borough President Marty Markowitz were on hand to send off the first riders, with Markowitz half-jokingly and half-seriously yelling out “Don’t forget to return to return to Brooklyn!!!”</p><p>In addition, NYC & Company, in conjunction with New York Water Taxi, is piloting a new ferry service between Brooklyn Bridge Park and Manhattan Friday to Sunday. Free ferries will also continue to run between Lower Manhattan and Governors Island every Friday to Sunday.</p><p>“Brooklyn Bridge Park and Governors Island are two of New York City’s most spectacular public spaces that are reconnecting New Yorkers and visitors from around the world to our waterfront,” said Bloomberg said. “Not only will they both provide new opportunities for recreation, they will also host an array of arts and cultural programs. It will be an exciting summer for the two destinations, and it’s just the start of what’s to come for both.”</p><p>After over 25 years of planning and false promises, the first segment of the 85-acre park opened in April at Pier 1 in DUMBO and features a grand esplanade and beautiful rolling lawns. Another section at nearby uplands by Pier 2 is in line open by the end of the summer. The rest is being built piecemeal as money is secured.</p><p>******</p><p>Related story:</p><p><a class=legacy-link href=#>Brooklyn Bridge Park’s Pier 6 to Open Saturday with new Gov.
