His untimely death has shattered the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to know him. His unexpected departure on December 6, 2023, had a significant effect on the small town where he lived his whole life. Micah, who was born on December 8, 1985, exemplified perseverance and commitment.</p><p>Starting his first business at the tender age of sixteen, his innate entrepreneurial spirit was already apparent. He continued the family business of loggers started by his grandpa Edward and continued by his dad Mark for 18 years as the head of Ladner Investments, LLC. Only his devotion to his family could rival his dedication to his work. Micah’s selfless character shone through as he was always willing to lend a helping hand to those he knew were in need.</p><p>After 14 years of marriage, he was a loving husband and father to Shauna’s three sons—Hayden, Owen, and Sam—with whom he shared his enthusiasm for the outdoors. Micah, a devout Christian who was very involved at Wiggins’ First Baptist Church, left an everlasting impression on his neighborhood via his selflessness and kindness. Shauna, his sons, his parents Mark and Sue Ladner, his brother Kyle, and other relatives and friends will miss him dearly. The Ladner grandparents—Edward, Janet, Admiral, and Micah—passed away before he was born.</p><p>We will gather at the First Baptist Church of Wiggins for a visitation on Saturday, December 9, beginning at 5 PM. On Sunday, December 10, at 2 PM, we will have funeral services, and we will end at Woodlawn Cemetery for a graveside service. The First Baptist Church of Wiggins would appreciate contributions in lieu of flowers in memory of Micah. Those who were fortunate enough to know him will always carry the weight of his work ethic, generosity, and steadfast devotion to his loved ones and the community.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiao5x7prDUZ62nZ52esKK0jKiunqZdoa6lusSrZKiamanCor7YZphmpJmbsq27zaBkq52jnrGmutNmpp9lp560qLXNrGShmaNiwKKwy7JkqZmjqLKlecCwmLJllJqutbSMrZ%2BeZaekv62wjKiZoqyjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
