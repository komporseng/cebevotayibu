All its family members find instant fame, even the newly born kids. That’s exactly the case for Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian’s daughter Dream Renee Kardashian, who is having a stunning life thanks to her parent’s Net worth of $14 million.</p><p>Dream Rene Kardashian, who is simply known as Renee was born on November 10, 2016, is only 1 year old. While still being an infant, she has a luxurious life and is probably richer than a lot of people. But the question is, is she richer than another rich kid in Hollywood, Ashad Tuck Khaled. The answer is unfortunately no.</p><p>Ashad Tuck Khaled is the son of music mogul DJ Khaled. He is already a music producer and produces his father’s songs and albums. At 2 years of age, he is already <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>worth a stunning $4 million dollars</a>. While Dream is relying&nbsp;on her parents’ money, Ashad is making his own, which&nbsp;makes him the richer child among the two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dream-Renee-Kardashian.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth_of_Dream_Renee_Kardashian_and_Glamourous_Lifestyle></span>Net Worth of Dream Renee Kardashian and&nbsp; Glamourous Lifestyle<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The 1-year-old daughter of Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna is swimming in riches. Though Dream doesn’t have her own net worth, she has a comfortable life thanks to her parents’ money. Her father Rob Kardashian is worth <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">a massive $10 million</a> whereas her mother Blac Chyna is not poor herself with a respectable net worth of $4 million.</p><p>Thanks to all this money of her Mom and Dad, Dream has been living a glamorous lifestyle. She wears stylish clothes that make&nbsp;her look like a princess. She travels around with both her parents and enjoys her tender life very much. Rob takes his daughter for swimming and to zoos as well.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Dream’s first trip to the zoo! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0XtfYuv8hQ</a></p><p>— ROBERT KARDASHIAN (@robkardashian) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">October 13, 2017</a></p><p><br>Rob and Chyna, despite their differences, make sure that their daughter gets everything she wants. As a result, Dream lives a happy and exotic life, enjoying vacations&nbsp;and traveling&nbsp;all over the world. She also enjoys festivals and events like Halloween, where she dressed up as a Raggedy Ann.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Dream-Kardashian-halloween.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dream_Not_Quite_As_Rich_As_Ashad_Tuck_Khaled></span>Dream Not Quite As Rich As Ashad Tuck Khaled<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite her riches and glamorous lifestyle, Dream doesn’t quite match up to DJ Khaled’s son Ashad Tuck Khaled. Unlike Dream,&nbsp; Ashad doesn’t depend on his father DJ Khaled’s Net worth of $40 million but rather earns his own money by producing his father’s music as well as his albums.</p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by Asahd Tuck Khaled (@asahdkhaled)</a> on Jul 29, 2017 at 12:24pm PDT</p><p>At the age of just 2, Ashad has accumulated a net worth of $4 million thanks to his work as a producer.
