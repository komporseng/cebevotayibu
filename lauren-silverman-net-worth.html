Silverman came out on the spotlight when she started seeing <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>, renowned producer, music mogul, television personality and judge of shows like “American Idol” and “X-Factor”.</p><p>So how much is Silverman’s net worth? As of early 2017, based on authoritative sources it is reported to be $10 million. The money consists mainly of her family’s funds and her so-called profession as a New York Socialite.</p><h3>Lauren Silverman Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Born in New York, Silverman is the son of Steven Davis, who worked as an accountant, while her mother, Carole Eisenberg, worked in the real estate industry. She also has one younger sister, Nicole Alexandra Davis. Although she has no clear profession, she is passionate in reading, theatre and various charities.</p><p>Silverman was born into a pretty comfortable upbringing with her parents riches. Despite not having any work experiences, her net worth is well intact due to her family’s personal funds.</p><p>At the young age of 20, she apparently fell in love with and married real estate developer <a href=#>Andrew Silverman</a> in the late ‘90s. Despite their young age, the two supposedly loved each other dearly, and in 2006 they welcomed their son Adam.</p><p>After 10 years of being married, Silverman became the center of controversy when her husband, <a href=#>Andrew</a> discovered that she was having an affair, which became public when it became known that it was with famous producer and television personality, <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>, who was apparently a close friend of <a href=#>Andrew</a>, and who had become popular over the years because of his shows “American Idol”, “The X Factor”, “America’s Got Talent” and “Britain’s Got Talent”, to name a few. Silverman eventually admitted her relationship with <a href=#>Cowell</a>, and the two became public knowledge. Silverman’s divorce to Andrew soon followed. The two were able to make an agreement with their son, Adam. Andrew was able to keep their son, and she was able to see him once a week.</p><p>In a somewhat confusing arrangement, after a couple of months of being together, in 2014 the two welcomed their son, Eric Cowell. Today, Silverman and <a href=#>Cowell</a> are still dating and have no plans of tying the knot anytime soon. They also decided to keep their relationship private, but they are occasionally seen in public when attending parties and social events.</p><p>In terms of her personal life, Silverman is still with <a href=#>Cowell</a> and has maintained a good relationship with his eldest son, Adam.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqWYrqqVo3q0tcuvnKulkaN6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
