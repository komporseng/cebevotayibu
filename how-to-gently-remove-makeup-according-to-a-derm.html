According to Lindsey Zubritzky, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in O’Hara Township, Pennsylvania, the last thing you want to use is a makeup wipe.</p><p>“Makeup wipes are actually the worst thing you could ever use for your face,” says Dr. Zubritzky in a recent TikTok. “Not only are they bad for the environment, but they literally just smear your makeup around and don’t actually clean your skin.” She also notes how red her skin gets from having to aggressively wipe her face.</p>@dermguru Theres infinite reasons I despise #MakeupWipes #TikTokTaughtMe #TikTokPartner #MakeupRemoval #SkinTok #DermGuru ♬ Sip (Alcohol) – Joeboy<p>The right way to remove your makeup, she says, is much gentler.</p><h3>1. Rinse with a cleansing oil, balm, or micellar water</h3><p>“I always always always recommend a double cleanse if you wear a lot of makeup so you can either use a cleansing oil or micellar water or cleansing balm for the first step,” she says. “If you’re using a cleansing oil, you want to make sure that you work it into dry hands.” She likes to use the Naturium Camellia Creamy Cleansing Oil ($20) to melt off her makeup. It has a gel-to-oil formula that uses fermented camellia oil and extract plus linoleic-rich oils to gently dissolves makeup, oil, SPF, and more.</p><p>If you prefer to use micellar water, the La Roche-Posay Micellar Cleansing Water ($17) is a wonderful option. It’s made with microscopic oil molecules—called micelles— that are suspended in water and work to remove dirt and hydrate your skin.</p><h3>2. Finish off with a gentle cleanser</h3><p>Next, Dr. Zubritsky rinses off the cleansing oil and does her second wash with a super-gentle cleanser. “It doesn’t have to be anything crazy,” she says. She uses the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser ($17). It’s a non-foaming mace wash made with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and glycerin to leave your face clean and hydrated.</p><p>Get some more derm-skin-care routine inspo:</p><p></p><p><strong>Want to be the first to hear about the latest (and greatest) SHOP product drops, custom collections, discounts, and more?
