Beyonce’s father took over as the group’s manager, and the quartet was on its way to becoming a hit. With their street cool image and outstanding vocal harmonies, the band quickly gained a large following in the area.</p><p>Then, in 1997, they were signed to Columbia Records and released Killing Time, which was featured on the Men In Black album. Their self-titled debut album, released in 1998, featured collaborations with top R&B/hip-hop producers Timbaland, R. Kelly, and Wyclef Jean. The album’s first song, No No No, entered the Top 10 in both the United States and the United Kingdom, and was followed by further singles such as With Me and Get On The Bus.</p><p>The group replaced LaTivia Roberson and LeToya Luckett due to personal issues, and added Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams. LaTavia and LeToya founded the group Angel with another singer named Nadia after they left the group. The ensemble, however, didn’t last long, and LaTavia stepped away from the music. She began appearing in TV shows such as Top of the Pops (1998-1999) and The Real Housewives of Atlanta after a few years (2010). She works as a motivational speaker, actress, and radio host right now.</p><p>You may also like <a href=# rel=bookmark>Audrina Patridge.</a></p><h2 class="title celeb_stats_table_header">Quick Facts of LaTavia Roberson</h2><table class=celeb_stats_table style=width:60.8759%;height:197px><tbody><tr class=row-fill><td style=width:24.7525%>Net Worth:</td><td style=width:96.0396%><strong>$500 Thousand</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=width:24.7525%>Date of Birth:</td><td style=width:96.0396%>Nov 1, 1981 (39 years old)</td></tr><tr><td style=width:24.7525%>Gender:</td><td style=width:96.0396%>Female</td></tr><tr><td style=width:24.7525%>Profession:</td><td style=width:96.0396%>Singer, Actor, Rapper, Model, Songwriter</td></tr><tr><td style=width:24.7525%>Nationality:</td><td style=width:96.0396%><a href=# rel=nofollow>United States of America</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKSRqa63tcBmqaialafAsLqO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
