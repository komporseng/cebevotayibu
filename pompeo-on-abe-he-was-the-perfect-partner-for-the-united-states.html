He’s out campaigning. He was exercising his political rights. It’s something that we all ought to be mindful of in terms of political violence.”</p><p>Abe was assassinated while campaigning in the Nara prefecture for his center-right Liberal Democratic Party ahead of Sunday’s election for the country’s upper house of parliament.</p><p><strong><u>FORMER JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE ASSASSINATED DURING CAMPAIGN SPEECH, HOSPITAL OFFICIALS CONFIRM</u></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/640/320/abe-shooting.jpg><p>In this image from a video, a man, center, is detained near the site of gunshots in Nara, western Japan.

And then, of course, got to know him better when I was CIA director.”</p><p>Pompeo noted that, as Secretary of State, he found Abe to be candid. “He was always straight up, ‘Mike, here’s what we’re working on, here’s what we need, here are the things we can do to help you,'” Pompeo recalled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/japan-abe-1.jpg><p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, answers questions from a reporter during a TV interview in Tokyo Oct. 22, 2017.<br><span class=copyright>(AP)</span></p><p>Pompeo, who served as President Trump’s secretary of state for three years, described Abe’s importance to the U.S. in combating China.</p><p>“He was the perfect partner for the United States as we began to both work on our economies together and deliver the deterrence that we’re going to need to keep the Chinese Communist Party at bay,” Pompeo explained. “I will miss him. the world, most importantly, will miss him.”</p><p><strong><u>TRUMP MOURNS JAPAN’S SHINZO ABE, ‘A UNIFIER LIKE NO OTHER’ WHO’ CHERISHED HIS MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY’</u></strong></p><p>Abe was a strong believer in the power of a U.S.-Japan friendship and spent his career hosting, wooing and negotiating with American statesmen.</p><p>Speaking earlier Friday to Bill Hemmer on America’s Newsroom, Pompeo said Abe was “relentless in putting them first, the Japanese people first,” while also noting that he was “a dear friend of the United States. He knew that a successful United States and a good relationship with us made things better for his own people.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/640/320/abe-trump.jpg><p>Former U.S. President Trump, left, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pose for a photo prior to their meeting at Akasaka Palace in Tokyo May 27, 2019.&nbsp;<br><span class=copyright>(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File)</span></p><p><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></p><p>Former presidents Trump, Obama, and George W. Bush have all spoken highly of their interactions with Abe.</p><p>Abe, his country’s first prime minister born after World War II, was <u>Japan’s longest-serving prime minister</u>. He served from 2006 to 2007 and again in 2012 until he resigned in 2020 after his ulcerative colitis, a chronic condition, resurfaced. He called his decision at the time “gut-wrenching.”</p><p><i>Fox News’ Ben Evansky contributed to this report.</i></p><p>Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, with a focus on immigration.
