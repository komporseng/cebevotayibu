It’s not the prettiest, but it’s special. All of the songs on ‘The Riversides’ are real stories I’ve experienced in my hometown. My main influences for this album came from listening to a lot of folk and country music with my family. As I close this chapter of being a college student in my life, the creation of this EP was a reflective experience for me to get closure on where I grew up.”</p><p>She goes on to add, “My music represents the most authentic parts of me you can get. There is a vulnerability that comes with opening up to random strangers and inviting them in. I love that music opens a door for everyone to be vulnerable and share in that feeling. I make music because it is how I internalize my emotions but also to create a sense of community as well.”</p><p>A native of Long Island, New York, Sarah’s sound conjures up suggestions of Maggie Rogers, Kasey Musgraves, and Brandi Carlile.</p><p>Encompassing five tracks, entry points include “Morningside,” a delicious, gentle tune featuring an acoustic guitar, austere bassline, and Sarah’s deluxe voice. “Amy” blends folk flavors with Americana textures, offering a glittering tune conveying hints of Southern folk savors. Radiant harmonies glow, surrounding Sarah’s rich, evocative voice with a shimmering aura.</p><p>Talking about “Amy,” Sarah shares, “This is a friendship breakup <a href=#>song</a>. Friend breakups hurt! They honestly hurt more than a romantic breakup because the person knows you so well and it’s always unexpected when you break. One line that sums it up for me is, ‘You’ve become estranged to what I sow, I’ll reap them as they grow.’ Sometimes we grow out of our friendships though, and that’s okay. This is a song about that.”</p><p>“Osprey Park” rolls out on a graceful acoustic guitar, imbuing the tune with mellow colors as Sarah’s crystalline voice, with just a trace of delectable rasping, infuses the lyrics with nostalgic hues.</p><p>Wonderfully wrought, The Riversides delivers gorgeous songs embroidered by the sumptuous, alluring voice of Sarah Gross.</p><p>Follow Sarah Gross <a href=#>Instagram</a> | <a href=#>Twitter</a> | <a href=#>Facebook</a> | <a href=#>Spotify</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kwKK%2BwKFkoKqfqMBuvsSlnJqrlah6orjLrqmippdiwamxjKugr52iqLalsdJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
